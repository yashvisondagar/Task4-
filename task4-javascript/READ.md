here the question was related product of array except of its own where if the array is of 
2,3,4,5 then the output will fall as 
ignoring 2 here then * others like 3 * 4 * 5 = 60.
then it follows the same loop like 2 * 4 * 5 = 40 and so on 
execution goes with declaring 3 arrays left right prod 
then iterating the left then right and followed by merging the prod 
finally printing the merged arr in prod
